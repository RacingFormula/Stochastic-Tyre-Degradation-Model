# Stochastic-Tyre-Degradation-Model
## Overview

The Stochastic Tyre Degradation Model is an advanced simulation tool that incorporates probabilistic methods to predict tyre performance over a race. By simulating random variations in tyre wear rates, surface conditions, and environmental factors, this tool provides teams with insights into how unpredictable conditions might impact race strategy and performance.

## Features

- **Stochastic Modelling**: Simulates random variations in tyre degradation rates and performance.
- **Customisable Inputs**: Configure track-specific and tyre-specific parameters.
- **Multi-Factor Analysis**: Considers variables such as track temperature, load cycles, and compound type.
- **Monte Carlo Simulation**: Runs thousands of iterations for probabilistic outcome prediction.
- **Visualisation Tools**: Generates distributions and trends for tyre degradation and performance.
